## 💡 Project Overview

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and Polycystic Ovary Disorder (PCOD) are among the most common hormonal imbalances affecting millions of women globally.  
Delayed diagnosis often leads to long-term health issues, including infertility, diabetes, obesity, and mental health challenges.  

Our project — **AI-Powered Early Detection and Lifestyle Recommendation System for PCOS and PCOD** — aims to address this challenge by integrating **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to detect early signs and provide **personalized lifestyle recommendations**.

The system acts as a **digital health companion**, empowering women with awareness, guidance, and accessible healthcare connections.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Early Detection
- AI-driven predictive model to identify potential PCOS and PCOD risks based on:
  - User inputs
  - Medical history
  - Lifestyle factors
- Generates an interpretable **risk score** categorized as *Low*, *Moderate*, or *High*.

### 🍎 Personalized Lifestyle Recommendations
- Tailored guidance for:
  - **Diet plans**
  - **Exercise routines**
  - **Sleep and stress management**
- Focused on long-term health improvement and hormonal balance.

### 📍 Nearby Doctor Finder
- Integrated with **Google Maps API**
- Recommends nearby doctors or specialists for consultations and appointments.

### 📆 Period & Symptom Tracking
- Allows users to track:
  - Menstrual cycles
  - Symptoms
  - Fertility windows
- Provides visual insights into health trends over time.

### 🧘 Mental Health Care Suggestions
- Offers personalized mental wellness tips and emotional support resources.
- Encourages mindfulness and stress reduction habits.

### 🌐 Blog & Community Forum
- A safe and informative space for women to:
  - Read educational articles
  - Share experiences
  - Support each other in their wellness journey

### ⏰ Reminders & Notifications
- Sends automated alerts for:
  - Doctor appointments
  - Period tracking
  - Daily self-care activities

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User Registration & Login:**  
   Secure login using JWT-based authentication.

2. **Health Data Input:**  
   User submits lifestyle details, cycle data, and symptoms.

3. **AI Risk Analysis:**  
   ML model analyzes data and predicts the likelihood of PCOS/PCOD.

4. **Personalized Plan Generation:**  
   Based on risk category, the system provides diet, exercise, and stress management recommendations.

5. **Tracking & Insights:**  
   Users track progress and receive real-time feedback.

6. **Doctor Finder & Community:**  
   Locate nearby doctors or interact with the wellness community.

## 🔍 How Our Project Stands Out

| Existing Solutions | Our Innovation |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Only track periods and symptoms | Provides **AI-driven early detection** |
| Limited lifestyle advice | Offers **personalized diet, exercise, and mental health plans** |
| No clinical linkage | Integrates **doctor finder and health reports** |
| Generic interfaces | **User-friendly, privacy-focused web experience** |

## 🌈 Benefits

- Promotes **early awareness** and self-diagnosis  
- Encourages **preventive lifestyle changes**  
- Builds a **supportive digital community**  
- Ensures **data privacy** and **security**  
- Reduces dependency on late medical interventions

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- 📱 **Mobile App Version** for easier access  
- 🩺 **Wearable Integration** for real-time data monitoring  
- 🌍 **Multilingual Support** for inclusivity  
- 🤖 **Chatbot for Mental Health & Query Resolution**  
- 🧬 **Clinical Validation** in partnership with healthcare professionals
